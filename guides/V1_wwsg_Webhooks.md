# Listen to events in a space (Outbound Webhooks)

Using Outgoing Webhooks, your App can provide an automated response to messages that members post in a space.  For example, you could have an app that listens for a trigger word such as "weather" in the conversation and every time it records this event, it responds with a message in the conversation that displays the current weather.  Basically, your app receives an HTTP POST from Watson Work Services when specific events occur in the space, such as the trigger word "weather", and then automatically responds.  

## Enabling Outgoing Webhooks
To enable outgoing Webhooks in your App you need to register your callback URL for IBM Watson Work Services.  

A callback occurs in these two situations:
 - Initially, when the callback is enabled  to verify that the URL of the callback is under the control of the person who registered it.  Note that during registration, the URL must be valid and resolve itself as a valid address. Additionally, the HTTPS certificate of the server that processes the URL is verified and stored. (see Preparing your app to Run to learn how to code the verification function)
 - And then, repeatedly for each event, for which the callback was added.

Each event must be acknowledged as being processed by returning an http status, such as 200, back to Watson Work Services

To register your callback URL follow these steps:
1. Go to **Your Apps** in the top navigation of this site
2. Select an app
3. Choose **Listen to Events** from the App Dashboard.  
4.  Click **Add an outbound webhook**.
5.  Add the callback URL and select one or more events.
6.  Click **Save**.

Available events are:

**message-created**: each time a new message is created in the space

**space-members-added**: each time a member is added to the space

**space-members-removed**: each time a member is removed from the space

**space-updated**: each time the space is modified

**space-deleted**: on space deletion

**message-annotation-added**: each time an annotation is added to a message

**message-annotation-edited**: each time an annotation that is bound to a message is modified

**message-annotation-removed**: each time an annotation is removed from a message

Details about event notification requests are described in the [Webhooks API Reference](../references/V1_OutboundCallback.yml).

Note: It's important that your App carries out the proper handshake sequence.  To learn more, read [Preparing your App](../guides/V1_PreparingYourApp.md).
