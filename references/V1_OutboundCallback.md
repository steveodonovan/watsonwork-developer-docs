# Webhooks


<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview
This API has to be implemented by the callbacks implementing outbound webhooks.

- Changes in version 1.5.0:
  - New event type and notification format for `reaction-added` and `reaction-removed`.
- Changes in version 1.4.0:
  - New event type and notification format for `message-deleted`.
- Changes in version 1.3.0:
  - Fields of input and output entities are correctly marked as required.
- Changes in version 1.2.0:
  - New event types and notification formats for `message-annotation-added`, `message-annotation-edited`, and `message-annotation-removed`.
  - Changed type of `time` fields to 64 bit (long) integers.
- Changes in version 1.1.0:
  - The verification process of outbound webhooks has changed.
  - The `GET` endpoint has been removed.  The `POST` endpoint is now used for the verification of outbound webhooks.

### Send an event to the webhook callback or verify a webhook callback.
```
POST /{callbackUrl}
```


#### Description
Callbacks of outbound webhooks are called in two situations:
- Webhook verification: Verify that the webhook is under the control of the person who added it to an app.
For verifications the `type` value in the body is `verification`.  A verification is successful if these conditions are met:
  - The response status is 200.
  - The JSON response body contains the verification challenge in the `response` value.
  - The header field `X-OUTBOUND-TOKEN` contains the `HMAC-SHA256` hash of the body with the `webhookSecret` as key.
- Event notification:  Each webhook callback is only notified about events for which it has been added to an app.
For notifications the `type` value in the body is the type of the event.


#### Parameters

|Type|Name|Description|Schema|Default|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Header**|**Content-Type**  <br>*required*|has to be `application/json;charset=UTF-8`|string||
|**Header**|**X-OUTBOUND-INDEX**  <br>*required*|Only used for event notifications.<br><br>An index that is increased with each successful event notification.  Each combination of app and space have their own counter.<br>Allows detection of missed events, e.g. because the receiving callback was offline for an extended period of time.|integer||
|**Header**|**X-OUTBOUND-RETRY-COUNT**  <br>*optional*|Only used for event notifications.<br><br>An index that is increased with each failed event notification and that is reset to 0 with the next successful notification.<br>Allows the callback to be idempotent.<br>A value of 0 (the default) indicates a regular notification, the first retry has a count of 1.|integer|`"0"`|
|**Header**|**X-OUTBOUND-TOKEN**  <br>*required*|Used for webhook verification and event notification.<br><br>An `HMAC-SHA256` hash of the JSON request body.<br>The hash is generated with the `webhookSecret` of the webhook as key.<br>This key is returned during registration of app and webhook.<br><br>This token can be used by the receiver to verify that the request really comes from Watson Work Services.<br><br>Note that this token is used primarily in request headers.  For verification requests it is additionally expected in the<br>response header.  In this case it has to hash the response body.  That means that for verification requests the `X-OUTBOUND-TOKEN` is<br>part of the request and of the response header and typically has different values in each.|string||
